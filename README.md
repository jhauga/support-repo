## Overview

This PR proposes using the top-left symbol as an additional homepage link. Scratching my own itch a bit here. But also, according to some research it is suggested to have both a top-left logo linking to the homepage, and a breadcrumb link to the homepage (which the site currently does).

### External User Research

The takeaway is derived from three articles: two from [nngroup.com](https://www.nngroup.com/), a UX research group; and one from [theadminbar.com](https://theadminbar.com/), a knowledge share community.

#### Research Takeaway Regarding this PR

User studies consistently show that users look for the homepage link in two primary places: the top-left corner logo and an explicit "Home" link in the main navigation or breadcrumbs - see [nngroup.com/homepage-links](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/homepage-links/#:~:text=To%20minimize%20homepage%2Dnavigation%20confusion,breadcrumbs%20and%20the%20site's%20navigation.) and [nngroup.com/design-principles](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/homepage-design-principles/#:~:text=1.1%20Ensure%20every%20page%20includes%20both%20implicit%20and%20explicit%20links%20to%20the%20homepage.). Also one study showed that highly technical site users are more likely to click the logo/symbol for the home page - see [theadminbar.com/website-navigation](https://theadminbar.com/should-you-include-a-home-link-in-your-website-navigation/#:~:text=All%20Devices%20%E2%80%93%20Website%20#1).
