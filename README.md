```text
Using your #file:SKILL.md of making web forms, create a stylish web from that
will be hosted on GitHub, so - no server side functionality. But with your skill
you have the ablility to demonstrate several possiblilites for handling the form
submission, and do so by applying clever javasscript when the form is submitted.
Create a cliche form with several `input type="text"`, `input type="number"`,
two `input type="checkbox"`, one `input type="radio"`, one `optgroup` with
`option` tags, and one `textarea`. Use the `label` tag accordingly, and make
three form fields required for submission. Completely redo #file:index.html with
the demo form.
```
