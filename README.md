# Support Repo

Support branch of repository for:

- [OctoPrint-CustomBackground pull request](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-CustomBackground/pull/37).

The `index.html` page is **smoke and mirrors**, but quickly illustrates function of feature request. The results are condensed and instantly applied, but after testing using `OctoPrint` in development mode the same UX procedure is followed, and the image updates similar to demo `index.html`. Additional GIF of test on `OctoPrint` development mode is below.

- `Ctrl + click` Navigate new pages [index.html](https://jhauga.github.io/support-repo/)

> [!NOTE}
> The `index.html` GitHub page is for demo purposes.
